    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>I'm ready to Learn HTML</h2>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>

    <h3>My Daily Schedule</h3>
    <p>Let me tell you how:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I learn more about web dev.</li>
      <li>I plan out my schedule.</li>
      <li>
        I use resources from <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- `li` tag is used to indicate the content inside as a entity of a list. `ol` (stands for ordered list) tag puts all the list in a indexed format, also it adds few spaces for all the listed items. Notice the gaps between line of listed items, they are less than the usual paragraph tags `p`. -->

    <h2>I am also planning a vacation.</h2>
    <p>I've been working hard and <em>really need a getaway.</em></p>

    <p>I live in <abbr title="Kansas">KS</abbr> so I want to visit a beach.</p>

    <h3>Places I'd like to visit</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>I've heard good things about the Caribbean.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>I've heard good things about going here:</p>
        <address>
          Margaritaville Island Reserve Riviera Cancún<br />
          Bahia Petempich Puerto Morelos, Mexico<br />
          Colonia Morelos, México 77580
        </address>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- `ul` (stand for unordered list) - puts all the elements inside in a list view, with same indentation for all elements inside as we observed in `ol` tag. Everything is the same, the only difference is that we now have every elements listed in a bullet point instead of number index. Moreover all listed elements does have spaces between them as now we have paragraph tad nested inside of `li` tags. -->

    <h3>Places I want to avoid.</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>North Pole</dt>
      <dd>I hear this is <strong>cold</strong>!</dd>

      <dt>South Pole</dt>
      <dd>This is also cold.</dd>

      <dt>Mountain Tops</dt>
      <dd>These are also cold.</dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- `dl` (called as description list) is where we pass `dt` (called description term) which shows a heading-like elements under which we can add `dd` (called term-description) which explain or list something in context to the `dt` tag. All of these are listed under `dl` tag just like lists. Also for every sets of `dd` tag there has to only one `dt` tag. Everything inside `dt` tag will have some indentation to show they are under the content store in `dt` tag. -->
