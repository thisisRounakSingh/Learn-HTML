      <!-- HTML can display many multimedia, one of them is an image. One can use `img` tag to put image into the DOM. The attribute `src` host either `Absolute Reference` or `Relative Reference` to the image path/location. The `alt` attribute will show a broken image icon with the text passed to it when the image fails to load into the DOM for whatever reason. `title` attribute as discussed in `lesson_03` will show a tool-tip showing the given text when user hover over the content using the mouse cursor. -->

      <!-- About `width` and `height` attribute in the `image` tag - From the 90's it was not always required to specify `width` and `height` of the image, the browser would figure out width and height itself, or we can use `CSS` to change these values if want some custom height and width. Now Google (Specifically Developers of Chromium), recommends that we do provide these values because of something called as `Cumulative Layout Shift`. What happens is that often we load the website but currently that browser Window is running is in the background so the browser has not figured out the space image needs, although the image has been loaded. Therefore when will click on browser to bring it on to the focus, the image shifts (if needs to), which may lead to unwanted clicks so to prevent that Google suggests to specify `width` and `height` values so that the browser render it beforehand. Yes, CSS will be applied if we specify the value there also, but it is just for precaution. As time proceeds fixes have been made in Chromium (And other Browser Engine) HTML parser to fix this. Also both the attributes takes values in pixels. -->

      <!-- A note about self closing tags - Since the introduction of HTML standard 5 (HTML5) self closing tags such as `img` or `hr` do not require `/` ending. For example <img> and <img /> both are correct and later one is totally optional. The thing is one can continue doing using `/` because once they will start doing ReactJS they will have to use `/` for self closing tags. In general also doing so do not disobey web standards. -->

            <!-- About `loading` attribute - `loading` attribute tells the browser what priority it should give to load the content. In web terms, the line to which we can see the content in our web page is called as the `fold`. To see more content below `fold` (if it is available there) one has to scroll down. If below `fold` there is an image, we can, using `loading` attribute can tell the browser whether to load the image as soon as possible or load when required. By default the value in the attribute is set to "eager" (even if we don't use this attribute it is there and set to "eager"), which means to load the image as soon as possible, but when set to "lazy", browser will not load this image until it is very close to the `fold`. -->

            <!-- In our case, the caribbean image is very close to the `fold` therefore it is loaded and cached immediately. To test this, go to the network tab of web tools and disable caching, choose `img` tag in the viewer and add many line breaks just above the image and observe in the networking section of web tools, how once we scroll enough the image gets loaded, we might not have reached the image, but since it is very close to the `fold` it gets loaded. -->
