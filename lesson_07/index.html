    <!-- Typically when asked to write an essay we divide it into three sections, the first paragraph which introduces the topic, the second paragraph which explains/debates/analyzes/describes the topic, the third paragraph which leaves us with questions-to-think/conclusions/message. Similarly how we structure a HTML document - the `header`, the `main`, the `footer`. -->

    <!-- About `header` tag - Indicates that the content inside it is heading or navigation area for its root element (main topic). It is a semantic tag, it has no affect on `DOM` style or format. When inside `body` tag it reflects that it is heading or navigation area for the entire page. Can be used not just for the whole webpage but to a topic or a section of the webpage. There can be more than one `header` element per-page but it should follow a hierarchy.-->
    <header>
      <h1>My Goal for the year.</h1>
      <!-- The goal of lesson 07 is to learn hierarchy (semantic tags) in a HTML document. Starting from this heading <h1> - Each document should have only one <h1> - as suggested by the course mentor. So here we are already correct. The heading tags goes to 6 - <h6>. Although typically all we need is till <h3>. We go down this series of 1,2,3 and so on till 6 for heading tags as we progress into documenting topic, sub-topics, and more nested topics inside of this sub-topic. -->

      <!-- <hr /> - We don't need horizontal rule anymore. -->

      <!-- <hr> tag also provide semantic meaning to our web page. They indicate topic change. This also help us to easily read our HTML document. We can remove the lines caused by these tags using CSS but it is good to have - as it maintains better SEO for the website, even though we may remove the line that differentiate the content beneath and above it.  -->

      <!-- When we say semantic tags we don't mean always means hierarchy rather "meaning" for our web page. Which will help search engines and browsers to understand the context of our webpage better, as below by `nav` tag we want to indicate that 'hey here goes our links to parts of the webpage that the reader/user might want to jump to'. Semantic tags are not generic divider (the `div` tag).-->

      <!-- Typically `nav` tags are used only on the `header` of the body and one in the `footer` on the `body`, but one can use it wherever required. To increase semantics, one can add a attribute called `aria-label`, set it to the purpose that the `nav` element serves. -->

      <!-- <nav aria-labelledby="primary-navigation">
              <h2 id="primary-navigation">Primary Navigation</h2> <- We can direct to this element using anchor tag. Therefore, for semantics, `aria-label` changes to `aria-labelledby`, which says hey instead of these elements being `x` they will be called as as `x` which is linked to `h2` whenever necessary. Helpful in case of multiple navigation menus.
            </nav> 
            
            We can also do something like this, where we can use an anchor tag anywhere on our webpage to direct to the `id`, which will take user to this primary navigation menu.
            `aria-labelledby` in this case describes that elements inside this are will be labelled as such.
      -->

      <nav aria-label="primary-navigation">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#html">Learning HTML</a>
          </li>
