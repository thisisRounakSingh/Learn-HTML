# Learning HTML5

- **The latest implementation of HTML from Web Consortium is HTML5.**

- **I don't aim to practice and use HTML5 professionally.**

- **Me and my buddy both aim to do web development therefore in that flow I am learning HTML5 as its basic knowledge will be required as we progress.**

- **Obviously one cannot learn all the possible HTML5 tags and its attributes, therefore mentor (Dave Gray) suggests to refer to MDN docs to know more about different HTML5 tags, although many concepts are covered which is more than enough. Future improvisation can be made using CSS which I am going to learn from the same tutor from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/).**

- **University Instructor [Mr. Dave Gray](https://github.com/gitdagray) is the mentor in this course.**
